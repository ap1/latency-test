Simple tool to tell difference in the latency of two displays. Displays bars on screen which flip at varying frequency. Wrote as an experiment but did not see any conclusive difference between my two displays (laptop display Vs. external monitor).

The laptop display did show a lot of tearing, did not notice that on the external display.
